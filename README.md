# Gamer Behavior and Ecological Awareness Survey

This project explores in-game player behavior (e.g., fishing, crafting, or cutting down trees) and real-world ecological\n
perspectives. A publicly available dataset was analyzed to assess how players interact with virtual environments and\n
whether those behaviors correlate with their attitudes toward ecological issues. 

The goal was to investigate whether a connection exists between virtual actions and real-world values, particularly\n
around environmental awareness, sustainability and ethical choices.



Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis comes from Science Data Bank (scidb.cn), and was part of a research project studying\n
ecological behavior in virtual environments.

Note: I did not collect this data myself - the survey and its questions were created by the original researchers. \n
This project focuses on exploration and analysis.
